```

---

## Features

- Automatically reads all sheets from an Excel file and converts them to tibbles.

  - Removing empty rows/columns.
  - Standardizing column names (e.g., snake_case).
  - Filling missing values using forward-fill.
- Supports:
  - Default configuration saved in the user's home directory.
  - Spreadsheet-specific configurations saved in the working directory.

  - Return as a named list.
  - Save directly into the global environment.

## Example Usage

### Saving and Using Configurations

1. **Save a Default Configuration**
   Save a default configuration file to the user's home directory:

   ```r
   save_default_config()
   ```

   This creates a file `.excel2cleantibr_config.json` in the user's home directory with default cleaning options.

2. **Save a Spreadsheet-Specific Configuration**
   Create a custom configuration for a specific spreadsheet in the working directory:

   ```r
   save_spreadsheet_config(
       "example.xlsx",
       list(
           remove_empty_rows = TRUE,
           remove_empty_cols = FALSE,
           standardize_names = TRUE,
           fill_missing_values = TRUE
       )
   )
   ```

3. **Automatically Load Configurations**
   When processing a spreadsheet, the package automatically:
   - Checks for a spreadsheet-specific configuration in the working directory.
   - Falls back to the default configuration in the home directory.

   ```r
   tibbles <- read_excel_tibbles("example.xlsx")
   ```

### Reading and Cleaning Excel Files

#### Basic Usage
Read all sheets from an Excel file and clean data using the default configuration:

```r
library(excel2cleantibr)

file <- system.file("extdata", "basic.xlsx", package = "excel2cleantibr")
tibbles <- read_excel_tibbles(file)

# Print the cleaned tibbles
print(tibbles)
```

#### Advanced Usage with Custom Configurations
Manually specify a custom configuration file:

```r
config_file <- "path/to/config.json"
tibbles <- read_excel_tibbles("example.xlsx", config = config_file)
```
